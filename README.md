# ecf_handling
Simple utilitaries to handle ECF text files

To handle the ECF files generated by RPA automation, generate a runnable jar file and execute in same folder where ECF file is located. You must create a secondary file called "contas.txt" that contains the accounts that will be replaced. If some account is not present in this file, the utilitary do not change any content.
